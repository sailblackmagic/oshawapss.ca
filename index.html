			<h2 class="headingtext">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
			<p>
				Here are some questions we receive frequently
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<i>I have a LOST or STOLEN Pleasure Craft Operator Card (PCOC), what do I do?</i>
					<p>
						If you received your Pleasure Craft Operator Card (PCOC) from a Canadian Power
						and Sail Squadron (CPS) and either you have lost it or it has been stolen,
						then no panic required, you have a couple of options:
					</p>
					<ol type="a">
						<li>

							With a credit card, you can get a replacement with a simple call to the
							National Head Office at 1-888-CPS-BOAT (1-888-277-2628).
						</li>
						<li>
							Simply go to this link on the CPS website:
							<a href="http://www.cps-ecp.ca/PUBLIC.asp?WCE=C=47%7CK=235624%7CRefreshT=235605%7CRefreshS=LeftNav%7CRefreshD=2356058">Card and Certificate Replacements</a>
							and follow the instructions.

							This page can also handle a PCOC that was issued by Industry Canada and
							Restricted Operator Certificate (Maritime) (ROC(M)) cards that were issued by CPS or
							Industry Canada.

						</li>
					</ol>
					<br />
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>What if I don't have the recommended prerequisite for a course?</i>
					<p>

						Talk to the instructor! Students without the recommended
						prerequistites most often struggle with a course and we want all our
						students to be successful and have positive experience taking our
						course. The instructor often do not have time to review all the
						information convered in the prerequisite courses. However, many
						students take a course with years of practical experience or have
						taken CYA or USPS courses. The instructures evaluate each case
						individually.

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Is there a minimum number of students required to hold a course?</i>
					<p>

						Yes, this is needed to offset the classroom cost and to keep the
						registration fees down. If interested in one or more courses, please make
						sure you contact the instructors early so we know you are interested and
						we do not have to cancel any course because of the lack of students!
						Thank you.

					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Does the Oshawa Power and Sail Squadron offer On-the-water Practical Training?</i>
					<p>
						No. On-the-water practical training is offered by the affiliated schools of
						<a href="http://www.sailing.ca/keelboats-cruising-s15686" target="_blank">Sail Canada</a>,
						one of our partners in education.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<i>Do the instructors get paid?</i>
					<p>
						No. All the Oshawa Power and Sail Squadrons instructors are
						volunteers that are dedicated to making boating safe and enjoyable for
						everyone. Our instuctors have taken, or are scheduled to take, the
						CPS-ECP instructor training course which covers many topics including
						many adult learning.

						<p>
							Presenter: Richard Button
						</p>
						<p>
							Back by popular demand from last year's schedule. We all have dock line, etc.
							with loops on the end that need replacing from time to time. You can buy lines
							already make up if your boat and the lines and the colours available match up,
							you can pay someone to splice the loops or the end of the lines, or you can
							take a few minutes and do it yourself. Richard prefers the latter method. He
							uses the diameter, length, and colour that he wants for all of his lines. Come
							out for a couple of evenings and learn how to splice loops in your own lines.
							We will use the 2 evenings to actually splice lines, so you will leave with
							practice and a sample of your work. We will put together a tool kit (for which
							there will be a minimal cost) you can take away from the sessions to do your
							own splicing at your leisure.
						</p>
						<p>

							Cost: $25 for both nights includes kit (refresher will be $5 for both nights,
							bring your own kit from previous classes)

						</p>

							to send an email to Allen Rogers.

						</p>
						<p>

							Class is limited to 10 kits for first time attendees and you must
							register in advance. Anyone coming for a refresher is welcome
							(no restrictions).

			<h2 class="headingtext">Our History</h2>
			<p>
				We're looking for stories of the Oshawa Power &amp; Sail Squadron and its members for this section.
			</p>
			<p>
				The basics are: the Oshawa Power &amp; Sail Squadron was formed in 1961; we currently have around 300 members.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Oshawa Squadron is a member of <a href="http://www.cps-ecp.ca/quinte/">Quinte District</a>; other Squadrons in the district are
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="http://www.cps-ecp.ca/ajax/">Ajax Power &amp; Sail Squadron</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="http://www.bayofquinte.org/">Bay of Quinte Power &amp; Sail Squadron (Belleville)</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="http://www.cps-ecp.ca/lindsay/">Lindsay Power &amp; Sail Squadron</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="http://www.peterboroughsafeboating.org/">Peterborough Power &amp; Sail Squadron</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					Prince Edward Power &amp; Sail Squadron (Picton)
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="http://www.cps-ecp.ca/rcaftrenton/">RCAF Power &amp; Sail Squadron (Trenton)</a>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Rendezvous, the annual meeting of Quinte Squadron, is also the venue for some fierce competitions, as
				squadron members show their excellent navigational abilities.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 2002, the Oshawa Squadron successfully defended the Richardson and McNea trophies. Fighting off 3
				strong competitors, the Oshawa team of Richard Button, Suzanne Askin, and Keith Welsh skippering his
				33' Sea Ray, Bonnie G II, have seen to it that the trophies stay in Oshawa for another year.
			</p>
			<p>
				All competitors had to contend with 60 Km/hr winds blowing most of the day on Lake Chemong, making the
				both the cruise and predicted log competitions especially challenging.
			</p>
			<p>
				The first competition for the Richardson trophy was a cruise very much the same as one from the boating
				course; taking bearings on landmarks, working with 60DST and estimating position. The high winds played
				havoc with the markers that were placed out in the lake, knocking some over or churning up waves that
				obscured the markers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Challenging the Oshawa boat was Phil Keegan and a crew from the Peterborough Squadron. Phil was at the helm
				of Cat's Paw, his 29' Carver, and his crew of Mel Little, Bob Lockie and Mike Pulcine worked together on
				spotting the marks and landmarks and doing the math in the choppy conditions.
			</p>
			<p>
				The second competition was the predicted log competition for the McNea trophy. The competitors had to predict
				the time to complete each leg of a short multi leg cruise at a set speed. Easy enough using 60DST, but made
				more challenging by having to factor in the 60 km/hr wind. The Oshawa crew won the competition for the fourth
				consecutive year.
			</p>
			<p>
				The challengers were a crew of novices from the Peterborough Squadron who scored a very close 1/100 of a point
				behind Oshawa. They didn't sail away empty handed though as they won the Roy Edwards trophy which is awarded
				to crews competing for their first time. Karen Morgan was the skipper of her 29' Thundercraft, Infinity, and
				had Carol Cook, Lena Lawrence, Marie Millard and Karen Walker as crew. They were very happy with their efforts
				and their trophy. The success of the novice crew is encouraging, showing that you don't need many years of
				experience to give the "seasoned" competitors as close contest, or even win.
			</p>
			<p>
				A special mention goes out to the members of the United States Power Squadron who came out to compete. Will
				Kirnie, immediate P/D/C of USPS District 6, and Peter Burke, P/D/C of USPS District 6, attended Rendezvous for
				the first time last year. They returned this year with their spouses and additional crew. Attending for their
				first time were Chris Tertinek, P/D/C USPS District 6 and his wife Marti. Even though they were not able to
				officially compete, the USPS crew tried both competitions and took back ideas for cruises and competitions for
				their own Rendezvous. Will extends an enthusiastic invitation to all members of the Quinte District to attend
				the District 6 Rendezvous to be held in Tonawanda/Buffalo area later this summer.
			</p>
			<p>
				Jim Doyle, Commander of the Bay of Quinte Squadron extends an invitation to all members of the Quinte District
				to come to Belleville next year. Rendezvous and Quinte District Annual General Meeting will be held in
				Belleville May 30, 31 and June 01 2003. The Bridge of the Oshawa Squadron encourages all members, whether you
				are a life member or just a recent graduate of the Boating Course, to come out next year and defend those
				trophies.
